# Project Initial Report

## Anusha Sharma (12106614)

### Project Name: DocConnect

DocConnect is a social media app designed specifically for doctors from the same organisation.

- Which problem is the project solving?

  - Hospitals often have large and diverse teams, making internal communication challenging. With this application, employees at the hospital can overcome communication gaps, share information including milestones and achivements, and also get to know other employees all on a centralised platform.
  - Organisations prefer to keep data private, because of this, exclusivity is required when storing and managing user data. Hence, having a separate platform is beneficial for the company's security.

- What are existing similar solutions?

  Social media sites like Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook are some social media applications that are open to the public for anyone to use.

- How do I want to solve it?

  - To solve the issue of exclusivity while also making sure that employees can contact each other, I will be following these steps:
    - Create an interface where all employees are connected to each other.
    - This app will encourage employees to post about the happenings in their work life such as milestones and acheivements.
    - Employees will be able to personally contact each other and form groups for messaging and sharing files.
